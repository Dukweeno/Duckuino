# Duckuino ![release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/Nurrl/Duckuino/all.svg)
Simple DuckyScript to Arduino converter.

If you need to perform mouse emulation then use [d4n5h's Duckuino](https://github.com/d4n5h/Duckuino).

*NOTE: If you are on linux, you might use the Arduino IDE from the website, not from apt, because the apt repo is not up to date.*

### Warning: Release note
This release is an unstable version, for now some things may or may not work, please [*open an issue*](https://github.com/Nurrl/Duckuino/issues/new) if you find a bug.

*The stable version will be released in few days, maybe :D*
